The main goal of this assignment is for you to know and prepare your data. It helps you understand the characteristics of data such that correct techniques and technologies can be selected to process and analyze the data later and make decisions.

Download carpet.csv and hardwood.csv data sets from the following website at the end of chapter three and describe them  http://www.uncg.edu/cmp/downloads/ (Links to an external site.)

Extract statistical information (e.g. number of observations, dimension of the data, mean of each feature, etc.) from these datasets. Also present visual representations (e.g. histogram, scatter plot, etc.) of the data. Is the dataset imbalanced, inaccurate or incomplete? Is it a trivial data or possibly a big data? Does it have scalability problem? Are they high dimensional? You need to write programs to read the data and do this.

Merge carpet.csv and hardwood.csv and create a new csv file called carwood.csv in which you insert a new column with label 0 for carpet observations and label 1 for hardwood observations. Now shuffle the observations randomly and create a new file called randcarwood.csv. Then divide this file into 80:20 and name the files with Trainrandcarwood80.csv and Testrandcarwood20.csv respectively. You must write a program to do these processes using a programming language of your choice. You can use Python. Include first and last three observations of each file (instead of all data, too long) in the text so that we know what the data samples look like in the files. Include code/commands and results of showing how many records in each file.

Submit a report file that contain both the code and text to Canvas. You can (but donâ€™t have to) use Jupyter notebook in Colab at https://colab.research.google.com/
