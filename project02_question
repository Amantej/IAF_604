Two Versions (nslkdd-version1.csv  Download nslkdd-version1.csvand nslkdd-version2.csv  Download nslkdd-version2.csv) of NSL-KDD datasets are given to perform the tasks for this section of the assignment.

Comparing Datasets
These datasets (Links to an external site.) are generated by capturing network traffic, extracting traffic features, and labeling them. What is the total number of observations in each dataset? List all the relevant statistical information about the dataset! In other words, compare these two datasets and document the similarities and the dissimilarities in these two datasets. Also, document the useful and not useful data characteristics in both datasets. Which one of these two datasets is useful to perform network traffic classification using random forest technique? Do you think this dataset needs further processing for cleaning, training, efficiency,…?

Apply the Random Forest Technique
Then apply random forest technique to classify the traffic types and extract variables of importance. (For variable importance, in python there is a way to select the important features—plot it as a histogram). It means the random forest algorithm provides the variable list with an order of importance for the classification accuracy that was achieved. As the next step, by eliminating one feature at a time, from the least important to the most important, get accuracies for the random forest and use them to decide how much dimensionality reduction can be achieved. In other words, find the subset of features (subspace) that gives similar accuracy as the entire feature space. Use quantitative measures (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). Also, use misclassification and out-of-bag errors as measures to interpret and discuss the results.
