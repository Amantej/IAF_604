For this Assignment, we are concentrating on the KNN algorithm.

However, I am not assigning any dataset for this assignment. I want you to choose a dataset and give a justification for applying the KNN algorithm on that dataset.

What type of data is suitable for performing KNN algorithm?
In which situations, can we conduct this algorithm?
Do not choose either the Iris or TeleCustomers datasets given in my example.

Write clear comments for each step you're performing on the dataset.

I am not providing any instructions here about the algorithm. But I am attaching an ipython notebook, it provides clear steps for performing KNN algorithm. I am also including a link about the algorithm. Please read the instructions clearly before approaching me regarding finding the data set!

If I see any irresponsible report or a document with poor explanation or unclear or an unprofessional output, I will reduce marks.

There is no one right answer for this assignment but, I need a clear explanation (strong argument) for your process. My main goal is to see how well you are understanding the application of the algorithm.
